This image represents the type of four-family property I aspire to own in the future. Owning an income-generating property to pass down to my daughter has always been a long-term goal. It motivates me to work diligently in my current program and to establish a successful career in IT. Achieving this goal would not only secure financial stability but also create a lasting legacy for my family.
